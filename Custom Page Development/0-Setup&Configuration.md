## ‚úçÔ∏è Create a Developer Environment

[Developer environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/create-developer-environment) allow for any Microsoft 365 user (subject to tenant level restrictions) to create up to three environments for personal development, testing and other non-production purposes. Each developer environment comes with up to 2GB of Dataverse storage, and allows you to create apps, automations and more.

1. Navigate to the [Power Apps Developer Plan page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps/free) and click on **Start Free**:

3. When prompted, sign in using your work / Microsoft 365 credentials.

4. You will be automatically redirected to the [Power Apps Maker Portal](https://make.powerapps.com). This may take several minutes to complete.

5. Once the Maker portal loads, a new development environment will have been created for you automatically and will have loaded. You can validate this by checking the following:
   - A banner message reading **This is a developer environment and not meant for production use** is visible on the screen.
   - When selecting the list of Environments, the current environment is shown as **\<Your Name\>'s Environment**.
